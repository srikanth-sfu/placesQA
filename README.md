## Abstract

Web users often post questions: "Does hotel X have a pool?", "Is museum Y wheelchair accessible?". The potential to automate the answering process presents an exciting challenge for AI systems, with many practical applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are not yet any public datasets for general question answering on the web. In this paper, we introduce the PlacesQA dataset, which contains 9,750 questions and answers about 750 unique places, including hotels, museums and nightlife venues, derived from questions asked by real users of travel websites.  This dataset serves as a testbed for general question answering.  For concreteness, we also provide sets of 73,148 and 181,266 images from these 750 places, obtained via web searches.  We show that images of these places on the web provide a rich source of information that can be potentially leveraged by an automatic question answering agent.
